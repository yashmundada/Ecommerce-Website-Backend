High-Level Design (HLD)
Architecture Components
Load Balancers (LB): Distribute traffic across servers for high availability (e.g., AWS ELB).
API Gateway: Entry point for routing requests, managing rate limits, and handling authentication (e.g., Kong).
Microservices: Separate services for modular and scalable architecture.
Databases: MySQL and MongoDB for structured and unstructured data.
Message Broker (Kafka): Enable asynchronous inter-service communication.
Caching (Redis): Boost response times for frequently accessed data.
Search & Analytics (Elasticsearch): Efficient product searches with advanced capabilities.
Typical Flow
Part 1: Product Search
User logs in and searches for a product.
Request passes through the Load Balancer to the API Gateway.
API Gateway routes the search request to the Product Catalog Service.
Product Catalog Service queries Elasticsearch for results.
Part 2: Add to Cart
User adds a product to the cart.
Cart Service stores the item in MongoDB and produces a Kafka message.
Part 3: Checkout
User checks out.
Order Management Service processes the order and sends a Kafka message.
Payment Service consumes the message to handle payment.
